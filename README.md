# Tweets_classifier
A tweet scraper and classifier script.

Using selenium, I log into Twitter, enter a search query and then scrape all the tweets in that category, 
later on, using Tkinter GUI all the scraped tweets are presented on a frame with a classify button attached to each one.
With the use of our made neural networks for classifying violence/offensive texts and images, we classify the tweet's text and images upon clicking the classify button.
