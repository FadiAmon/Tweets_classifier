# Tweets_classifier
An innovative script that scrapes and classifies tweets.

This script utilizes Selenium to log into Twitter, input a search query, and extract tweets within the specified category. The scraped tweets are then presented on a Tkinter GUI frame, each accompanied by a classify button. Leveraging our custom-built neural networks designed for classifying violent/offensive text and images, the script performs real-time text and image classification upon clicking the classify button.
